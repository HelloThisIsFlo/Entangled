  /*
  Notes:
  We want to implement feature 2
    - When receive a 'play' message with:
      - movieTime: current movie time
      - playAt: timestamp when to play
    - We want to:
      - Seek to 'movieTime'
      - Schedule a 'play' plex command at 'playAt'

  Question: 
    - How to check `seekTo` was called with the correct arguments? ✅
      => Have a section on the webui logging calls made to the MockPlexApi
      => And check that call to seekTo is there

    - How to check call to 'play' was scheduled at the correct time? ✅
      => Actually wait and check for call
      => Use delay of 3 sec (+/- 500ms for check)
      => Use same mechanism used to check for 'seekTo'
